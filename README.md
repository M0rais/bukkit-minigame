# Simple Explanation âœ¨

  - This minigame consists of a square with 4 colors divided into equal parts forming 4 squares within that large square. 
  - It will be communicated which square the player has to go and the time he has, at the end of that time the other squares will disappear for 5 seconds.
  - Also remembering that with each level that passes the time will decrease 1 second of the previous having at least 1 second.
  - Only one person win or if they die at the same time there is a draw.
  - There will also be kits and "pvp enabled" (it won't do damage, it'll just knockback) to prevent people from making the bug from shifting at the middle end.
  - There will be a tag for the chat and scoreboard with the highest level the player has ever reached within the minigame. (PlaceholderAPI)
